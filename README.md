# CSE-310-Rust

# Overview

This software is a command-line driven application that talks to a user, does some simple arithmetic, and closes. It features loops, variables, structures, slicing, expressions, conditionals, functions, and data structures including vectors, linked lists, and hash maps.

I wrote this software to teach myself about Rust and how it could be help me as a software engineer. I learned about the benefits of using Rust as well as the weaknesses Rust currently suffers from. While I prefer C-style syntax, Rust makes it easier to manage memory without a garbage collector. It also has great performance being a compiled language, however the lack of a traditional inheritance model makes it a poor choice for UI driven apps, as almost all UI frameworks rely on it.

* Rust

# Future Work

* In the future, I would like to write a program with a graphical user interface. While I was researching Rust, I found that Rust doesn't have a UI framework. I love the performance benefits of Rust and hope to see it support a mature UI framework one day.
* I would like to use the data structures in the program more effectively.
* I think Rust could work really well for server-side code, and I would love to write server-side projects in Rust.
