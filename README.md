# CSE-310-Rust

# Overview

{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Rust language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walk through of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

Tools
* Visual Studio Code

Languages
* Rust

# Useful Websites

* [The Official Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
* [Learn Rust - Official Site](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)

# Future Work

* In the future, I would like to write a program with a graphical user interface. While I was researching Rust, I found that Rust doesn't have a UI framework. I love the performance benefits of Rust and hope to see it support a mature UI framework one day.
* I would like to use the data structures in the program more effectively.
* I think Rust could work really well for server-side code, and I would love to write server-side projects in Rust.
